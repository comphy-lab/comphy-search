    "content": "Bubble bursting at the liquid\u2013air interface is a ubiquitous phenomenon. Whether in a glass of champagne, a carbonated beverage, or a natural setting (e.g., mudpots, ocean spray), bubbles rise due to buoyancy and eventually rupture at the free surface. Upon bursting, the cavity created in the free surface collapses, generating jets and ejected droplets. These droplets play important roles in: - **Aromatic transport** in champagne and sparkling beverages. - **Pathogen and aerosol spread** in contaminated water or biological fluids (coughing, sneezing). - **Cloud formation** through sea spray in the atmosphere. - **Geophysical processes**, such as mudpots or volcanic lakes involving complex rheology.",

    "content": "When the bubble film ruptures, a \u201chole\u201d forms in the thin liquid interface. Surface tension drives capillary waves that converge at the bottom of the cavity, shooting liquid upward in a narrow jet. This jet eventually breaks into droplets, as observed in: - **Champagne**: Enhancing aroma and flavor perception. - **Contaminated water**: Ejecting micro-droplets that can carry pathogens. - **Viscoplastic mud**: Where the yield stress of the medium significantly alters jet formation and droplet size. - **Viscoelastic fluids**: Such as mucosalivary fluids during sneezing or coughing. Extensive studies have addressed bubble bursting in Newtonian fluids (e.g., water). However, **non-Newtonian media**\u2014including **viscoplastic** (mud, clay suspensions) and **viscoelastic** (polymeric solutions, mucosal fluids)\u2014pose open research questions due to their complex rheological behavior.",

(2002), Walls et al. (2015), Deike et al. (2018)] and experimental data from ongoing parallel experiments. 4. **Applications & Implications** - Relate findings to **aroma transport** in champagne, **aerosol generation** in pathogen-laden fluids, and **cloud formation** via marine aerosol. - Draw analogies to droplet formation in **coughing/sneezing**, focusing on the role of viscoelasticity in droplet sizes and distribution.",

(2002), Walls et al. (2015), Deike et al. (2018)] and experimental data from ongoing parallel experiments.\n4. **Applications & Implications**  \n   - Relate findings to **aroma transport** in champagne, **aerosol generation** in pathogen-laden fluids, and **cloud formation** via marine aerosol.  \n   - Draw analogies to droplet formation in **coughing/sneezing**, focusing on the role of viscoelasticity in droplet sizes and distribution.\n## Skills & What You Will Learn\n- **Fluid Dynamics Fundamentals**  \n  Develop an in-depth understanding of multiphase flows, capillary-driven phenomena, and wave\u2013interface interactions.\n- **Rheology**  \n  Learn how non-Newtonian properties (viscoplasticity, viscoelasticity) influence flow and droplet formation.\n- **Computational Techniques**  \n  Gain experience using open-source codes (e.g., Basilisk C) for high-resolution simulations, parameter sweeps, and data analysis.\n- **Collaboration**  \n  Work alongside experimentalists, compare numerical and laboratory results, and interact with theorists modeling related flows.\n## Supervision\n| **Supervisor**              | **Email**                                   | **Office**                |\n|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| **Ayush Dixit**             | [a.k.dixit@utwente.nl](mailto:a.k.dixit@utwente.nl) | Meander 250              |\n| **Coen Verschuur**          | [c.i.verschuur@utwente.nl](mailto:c.i.verschuur@utwente.nl) | Meander 114B             |\n| **Dr.",

He entered Bradford Grammar School at age 10, matriculating in nine subjects by age 14. Unable to advance immediately to university due to his youth, he dedicated four years in sixth form to developing mathematical expertise while acquiring fluency in German and French. In 1939, Oldroyd secured a state scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he established an exemplary academic record. He received the Rouse Ball Prize in 1941 and the Mayhew Prize in 1942 as Cambridge's outstanding student in applied mathematics, graduating with first-class honors. Oldroyd maintained strong academic affiliations with Trinity College post-graduation, returning as a research scholar (1945\u201346) and securing a junior fellowship (1947). During this period, he completed his PhD thesis titled *\u201cA mathematical discussion of some rheological problems,\u201d* with guidance and critiques from W. R. Dean (of *Dean flow* fame) and Alan H. Wilson. Dean and Wilson $-$ both Cambridge trained mathematicians significantly influenced Oldroyd's approach to fluid mechanics and solid mechanics. His doctoral work (PhD awarded 1949) established fundamental principles in non-Newtonian fluid mechanics, culminating in his Cambridge Sc.D. in 1958 for his substantial contributions to the field [^1].",

From 1942 to 1945 he worked at the Ministry of Supply in Aberporth, Wales, conducting rocket research for Britain\u2019s war effort. This foray into applied physics and engineering gave him practical insight into fluid and material behavior under extreme conditions. After the war, Oldroyd transitioned back to research in emerging areas of fluid mechanics. In 1945 he joined the Fundamental Research Laboratory of **Courtaulds** in Maidenhead, a major industrial lab focused on artificial fibers and polymers [^2]. Notably, his former Cambridge tutor, Alan H. Wilson, had also moved to Courtaulds, and likely helped recruit Oldroyd to this innovative environment [^1]. At Courtaulds, Oldroyd worked closely with experimental rheologists **D. J. Strawbridge** and **B. A. Toms**, who were investigating the unusual flow behavior of polymer solutions [^2]. These collaborations exposed Oldroyd to cutting-edge rheometry and puzzling phenomena \u2013 for example, B. A. Toms had just discovered the drag reduction effect (later called the *Toms effect*) where tiny polymer additives dramatically lower turbulent friction. Oldroyd became fascinated by such non-Newtonian effects and even suggested early on that *wall slip* at the pipe boundary might explain Toms\u2019s observations [^3]. This period at Courtaulds was formative: it immersed Oldroyd in real-world rheological problems, from the processing of viscose fibers to the oddities of polymer solution flows, inspiring him to seek a deeper theoretical framework for these `elastic` liquids. Oldroyd\u2019s first publications in the late 1940s already show him tackling non-Newtonian fluid mechanics with a blend of mathematical rigor and practical insight. He initially focused on *viscoplasticity*, analyzing the flow of **Bingham solids** (materials that behave as a solid until a yield stress is exceeded when they flow). In 1947, while still in Cambridge, he published a series of papers on the *plastic flow of Bingham materials*, developing a `rational formulation` of their equations of flow and solving flow problems between moving cylinders. These early works, drawn from his dissertation, addressed how yield-stress fluids deform, essentially bridging solid plasticity and fluid flow. By 1949, Oldroyd had broadened his scope to other types of non-Newtonian fluids: he examined steady laminar flows in non-Newtonian liquids and noted anomalies like pressure gradients in pipe flow that couldn\u2019t be explained by classical viscosity alone. He even proposed experimental methods to detect wall slip and other flow peculiarities at the first International Congress on Rheology in 1948 [^1]. These experiences convinced Oldroyd that a unifying theoretical description for *complex fluids* was needed \u2013 one that could encompass the behavior of elastic liquids (polymer solutions), viscous suspensions, and even solids with memory. This realization set the stage for his groundbreaking work in 1950.",

    "title": "James g. oldroyd - The 1950 Breakthrough: Formulating Rheological Equations of State",
    "content": "In 1950, James G. Oldroyd published what is now considered **\u201cprobably the most important single paper in theoretical rheology.\u201d**[^6] Titled *\u201cOn the Formulation of Rheological Equations of State,\u201d*[^4] this paper established the basic principles for mathematical models of complex fluids. Oldroyd addressed a fundamental issue: existing viscoelastic models at the time (such as the Jeffreys model) were not *frame-invariant* \u2013 their predictions could depend on the observer\u2019s frame of reference, which is unphysical [^5]. Influenced by earlier work of Sir Harold Jeffreys and by a 1946 study of bitumen by H. Fr\u00f6hlich and R. Sack, Oldroyd recognized that the way one computes the time-derivative of stress in a flowing material is crucial. In essence, he argued that when a material element moves, rotates, and deforms, the rate-of-change of stress must be evaluated in a *convected frame* moving with the material. To achieve this, Oldroyd introduced two new definitions of the stress derivative \u2013 the **upper-convected** and **lower-convected** time derivatives \u2013 which account for material rotation and stretching in different ways: > Lower convective Oldroyd derivative: > $$ \\stackrel{\\triangle}{A} = \\frac{DA}{Dt} + \\mathbf{A} \\cdot (\\nabla \\mathbf{u})^T + \\nabla \\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{A}. $$ > Upper convective Oldroyd derivative: > $$ \\stackrel{\\nabla}{A} = \\frac{DA}{Dt} - \\mathbf{A} \\cdot (\\nabla \\mathbf{u})^T - \\nabla \\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{A}. $$ Applying these ideas, Oldroyd showed that if one takes the classical *Jeffreys model* (a combination of an elastic spring and two viscous dashpots) and replaces the ordinary time derivatives with his convected derivatives, one obtains two consistent viscoelastic models [^5]. These he called \u201cModel A\u201d (using the lower-convected derivative) and \u201cModel B\u201d (using the upper-convected derivative) \u2013 known today as the **Oldroyd-A and Oldroyd-B models** [^5]. > Oldroyd-A (Lower convected derivative): > $$ \\sigma + \\tau_1 \\stackrel{\\triangle}{\\sigma} = 2\\mu^*(\\mathbf{E} + \\tau_2 \\stackrel{\\triangle}{\\mathbf{E}}),$$ > Oldroyd-B (Upper convected derivative): > $$ \\sigma + \\tau_1 \\stackrel{\\nabla}{\\sigma} = 2\\mu^*(\\mathbf{E} + \\tau_2 \\stackrel{\\nabla}{\\mathbf{E}})$$ Both models reduce to the same behavior in a stationary reference frame, but they differ in how they predict stresses in flows involving rotation or deformation of the fluid parcel. Oldroyd\u2019s 1950 paper thus laid down a clear *frame-indifference* requirement for rheological equations, a cornerstone for modern continuum mechanics of non-Newtonian fluids. It was a bold theoretical leap that immediately gave researchers two possible constitutive equations for viscoelastic liquids. > [!danger] Note: > Oldroyd, characteristically cautious, noted that choosing between Model A and B `depends on the physics` of the material, though he offered no immediate criteria for selection [^5]. Nonetheless, the mere formulation of these models has been instructive. It provided, for the first time, a concrete mathematical language to describe fluids with both viscous and elastic characteristics (*viscoelastic* fluids) in a way that is invariant under changes of frame. This achievement earned Oldroyd international recognition \u2013 including the Gold Medal of the British Society of Rheology and a special issue of the BSR Bulletin honoring his 60th birthday [^6] \u2013 and it set the stage for much of the theoretical rheology that followed.",

    "title": "James g. oldroyd - Oldroyd-A vs. Oldroyd-B: Weissenberg\u2019s Rod-Climbing and the Preferred Model",
    "content": "While Oldroyd initially presented **Models A and B** as two equally plausible formulations, subsequent insights and experiments soon favored one over the other. In the very same 1950 paper, at the end, Oldroyd himself included a telling calculation: the flow of an elastic liquid around a rotating rod. This was not an arbitrary choice \u2013 it related to a famous experiment by **Karl Weissenberg** a few years earlier. Weissenberg had observed that when a rod is rotated in a polymer solution, the fluid *climbs up* the rod against gravity (now known as the **Weissenberg effect** or rod-climbing effect) due to the elastic normal stresses generated in the fluid. Oldroyd wanted to see how his two model fluids would behave in this scenario. The result was striking: **Oldroyd-B (upper-convected)** predicted the fluid would climb the rod, matching Weissenberg\u2019s observations, whereas **Oldroyd-A (lower-convected)** predicted the opposite \u2013 the fluid would be pushed downwards (a \u201crod-dropping\u201d effect). The latter phenomenon had never been observed in polymer fluids. Thus, by comparing both models against empirical reality, **Oldroyd-B emerged as the more physically relevant model for polymeric (viscoelastic) fluids**. As Oldroyd and others noted, the *rod-climbing test* essentially singled out Model B as the correct choice for liquids like dilute polymer solutions. Oldroyd commented that Model B should *\u201cbe favoured\u201d* in such cases, aligning with Weissenberg\u2019s findings. (Indeed, the inverse \u201crod-dipping\u201d behavior of Model A was only realized decades later in very different materials, such as dense suspensions of particles, confirming Oldroyd\u2019s intuition that the choice depends on the material\u2019s microphysics.) ![](../_Media/James%20G.%20Oldroyd-1741126421305.png) > A classic demonstration of the **Weissenberg rod-climbing effect**. A rotating rod in a viscoelastic polymer solution causes the fluid to climb up along the rod, due to positive normal stress differences. Oldroyd\u2019s upper-convected Model B correctly captures this effect, whereas Model A would predict a downward dip, which is not observed in polymer fluids. Figure credits: [Henry Ng and Rob Poole, University of Liverpool](https://fluids.ac.uk/gallery/zoomify/665). Beyond qualitative rod-climbing, more detailed **microstructural studies** in subsequent years reinforced the supremacy of Oldroyd-B for polymeric liquids. In the 1960s, rheologists developed molecular models of polymer solutions \u2013 envisioning long polymer molecules as tiny spring\u2013dashpot elements or \u201cdumbbells\u201d dispersed in a solvent. When **John Hinch** and others revisited Oldroyd\u2019s models in light of these developments, they found a remarkable connection: the simplest molecular model of a polymer chain in flow (the **elastic dumbbell model**) leads mathematically **directly to the Oldroyd-B constitutive equation** [^5]. In other words, if one treats a polymer molecule as two beads connected by a spring dragged through a viscous solvent, the macroscopic stress evolution follows Oldroyd\u2019s upper-convected form (with the polymer\u2019s finite relaxation time corresponding to Oldroyd-B\u2019s parameters). This result explained why Oldroyd-B captured many polymer solution behaviors so well \u2013 it was essentially *derived from first principles* of polymer micro-dynamics. Oldroyd-A, in contrast, did not emerge from any analogous physical picture for flexible polymers. By the late 20th century, therefore, Oldroyd-B had become the **standard viscoelastic fluid model** for dilute polymer solutions in rheology and computational fluid dynamics, whereas Oldroyd-A largely faded from use. As John Hinch humorously noted, a survey of literature reveals thousands of papers employing \u201cOldroyd-B\u201d in their title or keywords, but only a handful mentioning \u201cOldroyd-A\u201d. ![](../_Media/James%20G.%20Oldroyd-1741126749363.jpeg) The reason is clear: Oldroyd-B not only passes key experimental tests but also has a firm basis in polymer molecular theory, making it the preferred tool for scientists and engineers modeling viscoelastic flows. The **legacy of Oldroyd\u2019s 1950 insight** is thus encapsulated in the ubiquity of the Oldroyd-B model \u2013 a tribute to his ability to capture the essential physics of elastic fluids in a simple equation.",

    "title": "James g. oldroyd - Later Contributions and Evolving Work",
    "content": "After 1950, Oldroyd continued to build on his framework and ventured into new problems, further cementing his status as a pioneer in rheology. In 1953, he published a notable paper on *\u201cThe elastic and viscous properties of emulsions and suspensions.\u201d* [^7] Here, Oldroyd extended his constitutive modeling to **multiphase systems**, showing how a mixture of a liquid with dispersed droplets or particles could exhibit viscoelastic behavior. He demonstrated (for a dilute emulsion of liquid droplets) that the interfacial tension of the droplets provides a restoring force against deformation, effectively giving the emulsion an elastic component [^3]. This work was an early example of **micro-rheology** \u2013 linking microscopic structure to macroscopic rheological properties \u2013 and it illustrated Oldroyd\u2019s knack for generalizing his models to diverse materials. He also investigated the effect of surfactant films on droplet interfaces in emulsions, recognizing that a stabilizing film could alter the combined fluid\u2019s elasticity. These studies by Oldroyd in the 1950s are considered pioneering, as they connected continuum rheology with micro-scale mechanisms in suspensions and emulsions. Oldroyd\u2019s theoretical explorations in the mid-1950s also produced insights into what we now call **\u201csecond-order fluids.\u201d** In a 1958 paper, he analyzed normal stress effects (differences in normal stresses) in steady flows of idealized viscoelastic liquids, using a general invariant formulation that included up to quadratic terms in stresses [^8]. Notably, he examined the conditions for the Weissenberg effect (rod-climbing) to occur \u201cin a positive or negative sense,\u201d essentially exploring the parameter space where a fluid would climb or dip around a rod. This comprehensive study brought clarity to how **non-Newtonian normal stresses** arise in shear and rotational flows, and it introduced what became known as the **Oldroyd 8-constant model** (a generalized linear viscoelastic model with eight material constants). Such work laid the groundwork for later researchers like Coleman, Noll, and Rivlin, who in the same era were developing the modern continuum mechanics of fluids. Oldroyd\u2019s approach was always characterized by careful attention to invariant formulation (he cited the earlier convected-coordinate ideas of F. Hencky and others [^3]) and by a desire to keep models as simple as possible while capturing the essential physics. In 1961, he published a survey in *Rheologica Acta* on *\u201cthe hydrodynamics of materials whose rheological properties are complicated,\u201d* [^9] reflecting on how to extend classical hydrodynamics to fluids with memory and elasticity. He even ventured into esoteric territory by exploring constitutive equations in a general relativistic context (a 1970 paper on equations of state in general relativity [^10]), showing the breadth of his mathematical curiosity. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Oldroyd remained an active, though not prolific, author. He was selective in his publications, preferring depth over quantity \u2013 in nearly 40 years he published fewer than 30 papers [^1], mostly as a single author. Yet those papers are dense with ideas that continued to influence rheology. He developed a theory of **viscoplastic boundary layers**. He also revisited thermodynamics and continuum mechanics, searching for rheological models consistent with the laws of thermodynamics (as seen in his 1976 reflections). Even in his final years, Oldroyd continued to synthesize his lifetime of insights: his last paper, published posthumously in 1984, was titled *\u201cAn approach to non-Newtonian fluid mechanics,\u201d*[^11] offering a grand overview of the field - a treat to read for our generation.",

    "title": "James g. oldroyd - Influence on the Rheology Community and Honors",
    "content": "Oldroyd\u2019s influence extended beyond his written work; he was also a guiding figure and mentor in the rheology community. In 1953, the same year he took up a professorship, he served as **Treasurer of the 2nd International Congress of Rheology** held in Cambridge [^2] \u2013 a gathering of the world\u2019s top rheologists. He later became President of the British Society of Rheology (BSR) from 1955 to 1957, helping to shape the direction of rheological research in the UK [^12]. Oldroyd had moved to academia in 1953 as Professor of Mathematics at the University of Wales, Swansea, where he also headed the Applied Mathematics Department from 1957. In 1965, he was appointed Professor at Liverpool University, eventually becoming Head of the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics there [^2]. In these roles, Oldroyd supervised a small number of doctoral students \u2013 notably **Kenneth Walters**, who completed his PhD under Oldroyd at Swansea. Walters would go on to become a prominent rheologist himself (co-founding the *Journal of Non-Newtonian Fluid Mechanics* in 1976) and later reminisced that although Oldroyd guided only *\u201chalf a dozen\u201d* PhD students, his impact on them \u2013 and on the field \u2013 was profound [^13]. Oldroyd\u2019s students and colleagues admired his deep physical intuition and his knack for reducing complex problems to their core elements. Amusingly, Walters recalled that Oldroyd was *\u201cno sportsman,\u201d* yet somehow many of his research students were star cricket players \u2013 a coincidence that Oldroyd, with his gentle humor, tolerated even if he didn\u2019t share their sporting enthusiasm [^13]. In recognition of his scientific contributions, Oldroyd received numerous honors. Cambridge University awarded him the **Adams Prize in 1964**, one of its highest accolades in mathematics, for his work on the mechanics of non-Newtonian fluids. The British Society of Rheology bestowed upon him its **Gold Medal** in 1984 (the year after what would have been Oldroyd\u2019s retirement), celebrating a lifetime of achievement in rheology [^2]. Tributes poured in as he reached his 60th birthday in 1981 \u2013 the BSR dedicated a special issue of its bulletin to him, and luminaries like professor R. B. Bird lauded Oldroyd\u2019s contributions.[^6] In fact, at the 1988 International Congress on Rheology in Sydney, Bob Bird gave an opening lecture entitled *\u201cThe Two JG\u2019s\u201d* in honor of **J. G. Oldroyd** and **J. G. Kirkwood** \u2013 comparing Oldroyd, the continuum mechanician, and Kirkwood, the molecular theorist, as two giants who bridged the gap between macroscopic and microscopic understandings of fluid behavior [^1]. This was a testament to how Oldroyd\u2019s work, particularly the Oldroyd-B model, had become a cornerstone that linked molecular theory with continuum modeling. Unfortunately, James G. Oldroyd\u2019s life was cut short in 1982 \u2013 he died suddenly of an apparent heart attack while on his way to the university in Liverpool [^2] \u2013 but his legacy endures vibrantly. His name is forever attached to the **Oldroyd-B model**, a staple in rheology textbooks and simulations, and his ideas on convected derivatives underpin all modern viscoelastic fluid theories. In computational fluid dynamics and engineering today, Oldroyd\u2019s models are routinely used to simulate polymer processing, biological fluid flows, and complex material behavior, enabling predictions of how materials will respond under flow with both viscous and elastic forces at play. In hindsight, John Hinch and other colleagues note that Oldroyd\u2019s genius was in formulating simple yet physically sound models \u2013 *\u201cthe first twelve pages\u201d* of his 1950 paper, as Bob Bird once remarked, *contained the seeds of an entire field*. By following a historical narrative from classical mechanics to modern rheology, Oldroyd essentially wrote the chapter that connects **Isaac Newton\u2019s** fluid (ideal viscous) to **James Clerk Maxwell\u2019s** elastic solid, and in doing so, he helped create the science of rheology as we know it. His work evolved from early studies of idealized plastic solids to the elegant Oldroyd-B equation, reflecting a consistent vision: to understand and predict the behavior of materials that are not purely solid nor liquid, but something in between. This vision, shaped by great mentors, wartime experiences, industrial collaboration, and personal insight, makes James G. Oldroyd a towering figure in the history of rheology and fluid mechanics \u2013 one whose influence is still climbing upward, much like the fluid on Weissenberg\u2019s spinning rod. [^1]: I. A.

Unable to advance immediately to university due to his youth, he dedicated four years in sixth form to developing mathematical expertise while acquiring fluency in German and French. In 1939, Oldroyd secured a state scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he established an exemplary academic record. He received the Rouse Ball Prize in 1941 and the Mayhew Prize in 1942 as Cambridge's outstanding student in applied mathematics, graduating with first-class honors. Oldroyd maintained strong academic affiliations with Trinity College post-graduation, returning as a research scholar (1945\u201346) and securing a junior fellowship (1947).

    "content": "World War II interrupted Oldroyd's academic pursuits but also broadened his experience. From 1942 to 1945 he worked at the Ministry of Supply in Aberporth, Wales, conducting rocket research for Britain's war effort. This foray into applied physics and engineering gave him practical insight into fluid and material behavior under extreme conditions. After the war, Oldroyd transitioned back to research in emerging areas of fluid mechanics. In 1945 he joined the Fundamental Research Laboratory of **Courtaulds** in Maidenhead, a major industrial lab focused on artificial fibers and polymers [^2]. Notably, his former Cambridge tutor, Alan H. Wilson, had also moved to Courtaulds, and likely helped recruit Oldroyd to this innovative environment [^1]. At Courtaulds, Oldroyd worked closely with experimental rheologists **D. J. Strawbridge** and **B. A. Toms**, who were investigating the unusual flow behavior of polymer solutions [^2].

These he called \"Model A\" (using the lower-convected derivative) and \"Model B\" (using the upper-convected derivative) \u2013 known today as the **Oldroyd-A and Oldroyd-B models** [^5]. > Oldroyd-A (Lower convected derivative): > $$ \\sigma + \\tau_1 \\stackrel{\\triangle}{\\sigma} = 2\\mu^*(\\mathbf{E} + \\tau_2 \\stackrel{\\triangle}{\\mathbf{E}}),$$ > Oldroyd-B (Upper convected derivative): > $$ \\sigma + \\tau_1 \\stackrel{\\nabla}{\\sigma} = 2\\mu^*(\\mathbf{E} + \\tau_2 \\stackrel{\\nabla}{\\mathbf{E}})$$ Both models reduce to the same behavior in a stationary reference frame, but they differ in how they predict stresses in flows involving rotation or deformation of the fluid parcel. Oldroyd's 1950 paper thus laid down a clear _frame-indifference_ requirement for rheological equations, a cornerstone for modern continuum mechanics of non-Newtonian fluids. It was a bold theoretical leap that immediately gave researchers two possible constitutive equations for viscoelastic liquids. > [!danger] Note: Oldroyd, characteristically cautious, noted that choosing between Model A and B `depends on the physics` of the material, though he offered no immediate criteria for selection [^5]. Nonetheless, the mere formulation of these models has been instructive. It provided, for the first time, a concrete mathematical language to describe fluids with both viscous and elastic characteristics (_viscoelastic_ fluids) in a way that is invariant under changes of frame. This achievement earned Oldroyd international recognition \u2013 including the Gold Medal of the British Society of Rheology and a special issue of the BSR Bulletin honoring his 60th birthday [^6] \u2013 and it set the stage for much of the theoretical rheology that followed.",

    "title": "James g. oldroyd - Oldroyd-A vs. Oldroyd-B: Weissenberg's Rod-Climbing and the Preferred Model",
    "content": "While Oldroyd initially presented **Models A and B** as two equally plausible formulations, subsequent insights and experiments soon favored one over the other. In the very same 1950 paper, at the end, Oldroyd himself included a telling calculation: the flow of an elastic liquid around a rotating rod. This was not an arbitrary choice \u2013 it related to a famous experiment by **Karl Weissenberg** a few years earlier. Weissenberg had observed that when a rod is rotated in a polymer solution, the fluid _climbs up_ the rod against gravity (now known as the **Weissenberg effect** or rod-climbing effect) due to the elastic normal stresses generated in the fluid. Oldroyd wanted to see how his two model fluids would behave in this scenario. The result was striking: **Oldroyd-B (upper-convected)** predicted the fluid would climb the rod, matching Weissenberg's observations, whereas **Oldroyd-A (lower-convected)** predicted the opposite \u2013 the fluid would be pushed downwards (a \"rod-dropping\" effect). The latter phenomenon had never been observed in polymer fluids. Thus, by comparing both models against empirical reality, **Oldroyd-B emerged as the more physically relevant model for polymeric (viscoelastic) fluids**. As Oldroyd and others noted, the _rod-climbing test_ essentially singled out Model B as the correct choice for liquids like dilute polymer solutions. Oldroyd commented that Model B should _\"be favoured\"_ in such cases, aligning with Weissenberg's findings. (Indeed, the inverse \"rod-dipping\" behavior of Model A was only realized decades later in very different materials, such as dense suspensions of particles, confirming Oldroyd's intuition that the choice depends on the material's microphysics.) ![Weissenberg rod-climbing effect](_Media/James%20G.%20Oldroyd-1741126421305.png) > A classic demonstration of the **Weissenberg rod-climbing effect**. A rotating rod in a viscoelastic polymer solution causes the fluid to climb up along the rod, due to positive normal stress differences. Oldroyd's upper-convected Model B correctly captures this effect, whereas Model A would predict a downward dip, which is not observed in polymer fluids. Figure credits: [Henry Ng and Rob Poole, University of Liverpool](https://fluids.ac.uk/gallery/zoomify/665). Beyond qualitative rod-climbing, more detailed **microstructural studies** in subsequent years reinforced the supremacy of Oldroyd-B for polymeric liquids. In the 1960s, rheologists developed molecular models of polymer solutions \u2013 envisioning long polymer molecules as tiny spring\u2013dashpot elements or \"dumbbells\" dispersed in a solvent. When **John Hinch** and others revisited Oldroyd's models in light of these developments, they found a remarkable connection: the simplest molecular model of a polymer chain in flow (the **elastic dumbbell model**) leads mathematically **directly to the Oldroyd-B constitutive equation** [^5]. In other words, if one treats a polymer molecule as two beads connected by a spring dragged through a viscous solvent, the macroscopic stress evolution follows Oldroyd's upper-convected form (with the polymer's finite relaxation time corresponding to Oldroyd-B's parameters). This result explained why Oldroyd-B captured many polymer solution behaviors so well \u2013 it was essentially _derived from first principles_ of polymer micro-dynamics. Oldroyd-A, in contrast, did not emerge from any analogous physical picture for flexible polymers. By the late 20th century, therefore, Oldroyd-B had become the **standard viscoelastic fluid model** for dilute polymer solutions in rheology and computational fluid dynamics, whereas Oldroyd-A largely faded from use. As John Hinch humorously noted, a survey of literature reveals thousands of papers employing \"Oldroyd-B\" in their title or keywords, but only a handful mentioning \"Oldroyd-A\". ![Polymer solution model](https://claude.ai/chat/_Media/James%20G.%20Oldroyd-1741126749363.jpeg) The reason is clear: Oldroyd-B not only passes key experimental tests but also has a firm basis in polymer molecular theory, making it the preferred tool for scientists and engineers modeling viscoelastic flows. The **legacy of Oldroyd's 1950 insight** is thus encapsulated in the ubiquity of the Oldroyd-B model \u2013 a tribute to his ability to capture the essential physics of elastic fluids in a simple equation.",

    "title": "James g. oldroyd - Later Contributions and Evolving Work",
    "content": "After 1950, Oldroyd continued to build on his framework and ventured into new problems, further cementing his status as a pioneer in rheology. In 1953, he published a notable paper on _\"The elastic and viscous properties of emulsions and suspensions.\"_ [^7] Here, Oldroyd extended his constitutive modeling to **multiphase systems**, showing how a mixture of a liquid with dispersed droplets or particles could exhibit viscoelastic behavior. He demonstrated (for a dilute emulsion of liquid droplets) that the interfacial tension of the droplets provides a restoring force against deformation, effectively giving the emulsion an elastic component [^3]. This work was an early example of **micro-rheology** \u2013 linking microscopic structure to macroscopic rheological properties \u2013 and it illustrated Oldroyd's knack for generalizing his models to diverse materials. He also investigated the effect of surfactant films on droplet interfaces in emulsions, recognizing that a stabilizing film could alter the combined fluid's elasticity. These studies by Oldroyd in the 1950s are considered pioneering, as they connected continuum rheology with micro-scale mechanisms in suspensions and emulsions. Oldroyd's theoretical explorations in the mid-1950s also produced insights into what we now call **\"second-order fluids.\"** In a 1958 paper, he analyzed normal stress effects (differences in normal stresses) in steady flows of idealized viscoelastic liquids, using a general invariant formulation that included up to quadratic terms in stresses [^8]. Notably, he examined the conditions for the Weissenberg effect (rod-climbing) to occur \"in a positive or negative sense,\" essentially exploring the parameter space where a fluid would climb or dip around a rod. This comprehensive study brought clarity to how **non-Newtonian normal stresses** arise in shear and rotational flows, and it introduced what became known as the **Oldroyd 8-constant model** (a generalized linear viscoelastic model with eight material constants). Such work laid the groundwork for later researchers like Coleman, Noll, and Rivlin, who in the same era were developing the modern continuum mechanics of fluids. Oldroyd's approach was always characterized by careful attention to invariant formulation (he cited the earlier convected-coordinate ideas of F. Hencky and others [^3]) and by a desire to keep models as simple as possible while capturing the essential physics. In 1961, he published a survey in _Rheologica Acta_ on _\"the hydrodynamics of materials whose rheological properties are complicated,\"_ [^9] reflecting on how to extend classical hydrodynamics to fluids with memory and elasticity. He even ventured into esoteric territory by exploring constitutive equations in a general relativistic context (a 1970 paper on equations of state in general relativity [^10]), showing the breadth of his mathematical curiosity. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Oldroyd remained an active, though not prolific, author. He was selective in his publications, preferring depth over quantity \u2013 in nearly 40 years he published fewer than 30 papers [^1], mostly as a single author. Yet those papers are dense with ideas that continued to influence rheology. He developed a theory of **viscoplastic boundary layers**. He also revisited thermodynamics and continuum mechanics, searching for rheological models consistent with the laws of thermodynamics (as seen in his 1976 reflections). Even in his final years, Oldroyd continued to synthesize his lifetime of insights: his last paper, published posthumously in 1984, was titled _\"An approach to non-Newtonian fluid mechanics,\"_[^11] offering a grand overview of the field - a treat to read for our generation.",

    "title": "James g. oldroyd - Influence on the Rheology Community and Honors",
    "content": "Oldroyd's influence extended beyond his written work; he was also a guiding figure and mentor in the rheology community. In 1953, the same year he took up a professorship, he served as **Treasurer of the 2nd International Congress of Rheology** held in Cambridge [^2] \u2013 a gathering of the world's top rheologists. He later became President of the British Society of Rheology (BSR) from 1955 to 1957, helping to shape the direction of rheological research in the UK [^12]. Oldroyd had moved to academia in 1953 as Professor of Mathematics at the University of Wales, Swansea, where he also headed the Applied Mathematics Department from 1957. In 1965, he was appointed Professor at Liverpool University, eventually becoming Head of the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics there [^2]. In these roles, Oldroyd supervised a small number of doctoral students \u2013 notably **Kenneth Walters**, who completed his PhD under Oldroyd at Swansea. Walters would go on to become a prominent rheologist himself (co-founding the _Journal of Non-Newtonian Fluid Mechanics_ in 1976) and later reminisced that although Oldroyd guided only _\"half a dozen\"_ PhD students, his impact on them \u2013 and on the field \u2013 was profound [^13]. Oldroyd's students and colleagues admired his deep physical intuition and his knack for reducing complex problems to their core elements. Amusingly, Walters recalled that Oldroyd was _\"no sportsman,\"_ yet somehow many of his research students were star cricket players \u2013 a coincidence that Oldroyd, with his gentle humor, tolerated even if he didn't share their sporting enthusiasm [^13]. In recognition of his scientific contributions, Oldroyd received numerous honors. Cambridge University awarded him the **Adams Prize in 1964**, one of its highest accolades in mathematics, for his work on the mechanics of non-Newtonian fluids. The British Society of Rheology bestowed upon him its **Gold Medal** in 1984 (the year after what would have been Oldroyd's retirement), celebrating a lifetime of achievement in rheology [^2]. Tributes poured in as he reached his 60th birthday in 1981 \u2013 the BSR dedicated a special issue of its bulletin to him, and luminaries like professor R. B. Bird lauded Oldroyd's contributions [^6]. In fact, at the 1988 International Congress on Rheology in Sydney, Bob Bird gave an opening lecture entitled _\"The Two JG's\"_ in honor of **J. G. Oldroyd** and **J. G. Kirkwood** \u2013 comparing Oldroyd, the continuum mechanician, and Kirkwood, the molecular theorist, as two giants who bridged the gap between macroscopic and microscopic understandings of fluid behavior [^1]. This was a testament to how Oldroyd's work, particularly the Oldroyd-B model, had become a cornerstone that linked molecular theory with continuum modeling. Unfortunately, James G. Oldroyd's life was cut short in 1982 \u2013 he died suddenly of an apparent heart attack while on his way to the university in Liverpool [^2] \u2013 but his legacy endures vibrantly. His name is forever attached to the **Oldroyd-B model**, a staple in rheology textbooks and simulations, and his ideas on convected derivatives underpin all modern viscoelastic fluid theories. In computational fluid dynamics and engineering today, Oldroyd's models are routinely used to simulate polymer processing, biological fluid flows, and complex material behavior, enabling predictions of how materials will respond under flow with both viscous and elastic forces at play. In hindsight, John Hinch and other colleagues note that Oldroyd's genius was in formulating simple yet physically sound models \u2013 _\"the first twelve pages\"_ of his 1950 paper, as Bob Bird once remarked, _contained the seeds of an entire field_. By following a historical narrative from classical mechanics to modern rheology, Oldroyd essentially wrote the chapter that connects **Isaac Newton's** fluid (ideal viscous) to **James Clerk Maxwell's** elastic solid, and in doing so, he helped create the science of rheology as we know it. His work evolved from early studies of idealized plastic solids to the elegant Oldroyd-B equation, reflecting a consistent vision: to understand and predict the behavior of materials that are not purely solid nor liquid, but something in between. This vision, shaped by great mentors, wartime experiences, industrial collaboration, and personal insight, makes James G. Oldroyd a towering figure in the history of rheology and fluid mechanics \u2013 one whose influence is still climbing upward, much like the fluid on Weissenberg's spinning rod. [^1]: I. A.

    "title": "Arrowheads in elastoinertial turbulence - Why do arrowheads form?",
    "content": "Arrowhead structures emerge from a flow instability driven by polymer elasticity. At high Weissenberg number ($Wi$, dimensionless stress relaxation time $-$ high $Wi$ imply strong elastic effects) and moderate Reynolds number ($Re$), an otherwise laminar channel flow becomes unstable to disturbances at the channel center. This **center-mode instability** begins as a pattern of vortices and polymer stretch in the middle of the channel, which grows and nonlinearly saturates into the arrowhead form. Above a critical $Wi$, the flow spontaneously develops arrowhead patterns; at higher $Wi$, these patterns persist and can dominate as a stable wave. At sufficiently large $Wi$, the chaotic EIT can give way to a single steady arrowhead state, indicating that this coherent structure becomes a stable attractor when elasticity dominates. **Polymer\u2013flow coupling:** The self-sustaining nature of an arrowhead comes from a feedback loop between polymer stretching and fluid motion. The polymer\u2019s evolution equation captures this interplay: $$ \\frac{D \\mathbf{C}}{Dt} = \\mathbf{C}\\cdot(\\nabla \\mathbf{u})^T + (\\nabla \\mathbf{u})\\cdot \\mathbf{C} - \\frac{1}{Wi}(\\mathbf{C} - \\mathbf{I}) $$ where $C$ is the polymer conformation tensor. In an arrowhead, the vortex pair generates strong shear and extensional flow that continuously amplifies polymer stretch along its arms. Because relaxation is slow at high $Wi$, a persistent high-tension polymer zone forms instead of relaxing away. That stretched-polymer zone exerts elastic stress back on the fluid, reinforcing the vortices that created it. Thus the vortices and polymer sheet sustain each other: the flow keeps the polymers stretched, and the polymer tension keeps the flow organized in the arrowhead pattern.",

They are the viscoelastic analog of coherent structures in Newtonian turbulence (like near-wall streaks and rolls), providing a clear `skeleton` for the turbulence.

    "title": "Arrowheads in elastoinertial turbulence - Numerical vs. Experimental Evidence: Do Arrowheads Exist in 3D or in Reality?",
    "content": "A critical question is whether these arrowhead structures are present in **3D flows** and experiments, or if they are artifacts of idealized 2D simulations. It has been claimed \u2013 and largely supported by evidence \u2013 that a single arrowhead wave _disappears_ in fully 3D simulations and has never been observed in experiments. Recent studies confirm that in a 3D domain, an arrowhead (narwhal) state is **linearly unstable** and quickly breaks down into turbulence. Morozov and co-workers performed a linear stability analysis of the 2D travelling-wave solution and found it unstable to spanwise perturbations when embedded in a 3D domain ([M. Lellep, M. Linkmann & A. Morozov, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 121:9, e2318851121 (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2318851121)). In other words, _\u201cunlike 2D, in 3D the narwhal in a channel appears to become unstable, leading to chaotic flows\u201d_. This means that a coherent arrowhead structure cannot persist as a steady state in a wide 3D channel; it inevitably triggers its own demise into disordered motion. Indeed, direct 3D simulations of EIT show the flow filled with multiscale, transient structures rather than a single arrowhead. The characteristic structures of 3D EIT are **sheet-like regions of high polymer stretch** and streamwise vortices (often aligned in the spanwise direction) $\u2013$ no long-lived arrowhead pattern is evident. Experimentally, too, **no** arrowhead or narwhal-shaped structures have been directly observed. Laboratory studies (using techniques like flow visualization or velocimetry in polymer solutions) report chaotic fluctuations and elastic \u201csheets\u201d of polymer stretch, but not a stable arrowhead wave. For example, experimental and high-Reynolds 3D DNS studies show polymers stretched in thin sheets inclined to the flow and emerging vortex tubes, with **no mention of a sustained arrowhead** structure. Recent research largely _supports_ these claims. The consensus is that the arrowhead/narwhal is a **2D artifact** in the sense that it cannot survive the spanwise degrees of freedom of a real 3D flow. Additionally, **no experimental evidence** of arrowheads has emerged, despite the intensive study of EIT in channels and pipes over the past decade \u2013 reinforcing the idea that such structures, if they form, are immediately disrupted in real flows. However, recent findings do _nuance_ this picture: even though a **stable** narwhal does not exist in 3D, researchers have noted that **transient** arrowhead-like patterns can _appear fleetingly_ within a 3D turbulent flow. For instance, simulations of low-Re viscoelastic turbulence sometimes display instantaneous polymer-stress contours resembling the arrowhead shape ([J. R. C. King, R. J. Poole, C. P. Fonte & S. J. Lind, arXiv:2501.09421 (2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09421)). These transient appearances suggest that the arrowhead solution still exists as an organizing saddle or ephemeral structure in phase space, even if it\u2019s not sustained. In summary, the latest evidence indicates that arrowhead/narwhal structures **do not persist** in fully 3D EIT or experiments \u2013 they are replaced by more complex chaotic dynamics \u2013 but they may manifest momentarily, hinting that they influence the flow as part of its underlying state space (rather than as an observable steady feature).",

    "title": "Arrowheads in elastoinertial turbulence - Role of Diffusion, Resolution, and Modeling Choices: Physical Feature or Numerical Artifact?",
    "content": "The formation and persistence of arrowhead structures are highly sensitive to modeling choices like polymer diffusion and domain dimensionality, raising the question of whether these structures are genuine physical features or numerical artifacts. **Polymer stress diffusion** in particular plays a pivotal role. In simulations of viscoelastic fluids (Oldroyd-B or FENE-P models), a small artificial diffusion term is often added to the polymer constitutive equations for numerical stability. Recent work showed that even an _infinitesimal_ polymer diffusion can qualitatively change the flow\u2019s stability characteristics. [M. Beneitez, J. Page, Y. Dubief & R. R. Kerswell, J. Fluid Mech., 981, A30 (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2024.50) discovered a _polymer diffusive instability (PDI)_: with a nonzero diffusion, the laminar flow becomes linearly unstable, producing a small-scale traveling wave at the wall as the primary bifurcation. Notably, this instability does _not_ exist when polymer diffusion is strictly zero \u2013 the base flow would be linearly stable in the absence of diffusion. The implication is that the arrowhead structure in 2D simulations can arise from the PDI \u2013 essentially a numerical artifact of including diffusion. The diffusive term \u201ctriggers\u201d a finite-amplitude arrowhead-like wave that would not naturally appear at that parameter set without diffusion. In reality, molecular diffusion of polymers is extremely small, so such an instability might never dominate the transition; the flow could bypass it via a subcritical route. Thus, one must be cautious: the beautiful arrowhead patterns seen in some simulations may owe their existence to an unphysically large diffusion or other numerical regularization. In that sense, they are partly a _numerical artifact_. **Numerical resolution** and dimensionality further affect arrowhead formation. Insufficient resolution can introduce excessive numerical diffusion (smoothing out small scales), potentially _artificially stabilizing_ a large-scale structure like the arrowhead. Likewise, restricting the simulation to 2D (as was done in the initial arrowhead studies) removes the 3D disturbances that would break up the arrowhead. The 2D assumption is a strong modeling simplification that essentially _locks in_ the coherent structure. As [M. Lellep, M. Linkmann & A. Morozov, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 121:9, e2318851121 (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2318851121) note, one cannot draw reliable conclusions about EIT dynamics from strictly 2D simulations. In 2D, the narwhal is \u201cbenign\u201d and can remain as a steady state, but this is sustained only because the normal 3D instability modes are disallowed. In a fully resolved 3D simulation, that arrowhead state sits on a razor\u2019s edge \u2013 any slight spanwise perturbation will cause it to oscillate or breakdown. Thus, the arrowhead\u2019s longevity in 2D is not reflective of physical reality; it\u2019s a consequence of an artificially constrained simulation. On the other hand, it\u2019s too strong to dismiss arrowheads entirely as a \u201cmere artifact.\u201d They are _mathematically legitimate_ nonlinear solutions of the viscoelastic flow equations (even if attained under special conditions) and they capture real physics \u2013 notably, a mechanism of polymer stretching and feedback. The consensus view is that arrowhead/narwhal structures are **embedded but unstable** features of the real system. They are \u201creal\u201d solutions, but one that the unconstrained system will only transiently visit. Diffusion and other numerical choices can exaggerate their prominence. In summary, high-fidelity simulations indicate that arrowheads do **not** represent a permanent physical flow pattern; rather, they are a byproduct of low-dimensional or diffusive modeling that nonetheless offer insight into the polymer\u2013flow interactions in EIT.",

    "title": "Arrowheads in elastoinertial turbulence - Conclusion",
    "content": "Recent research converges on a nuanced view of arrowhead (narwhal) structures in EIT. They were a landmark discovery as a coherent viscoelastic wave, and they have deepened our insight into polymer\u2013flow interactions. However, both simulations and theory now indicate that they are **transient players** in fully developed 3D turbulence rather than the primary architects of it. In fact, the energy transfer analysis between flow and polymer reveals that both chaotic regimes maintain through the same near-wall mechanism, independent of the weak arrowhead structure. These findings indicate that the arrowhead represents a passive flow structure, detached from the self-sustaining mechanics of elastic turbulence inertia (EIT) ([M. Beneitez, J. Page, Y. Dubief & R. R. Kerswell, J. Fluid Mech., 981, A30 (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2024.50)). The community\u2019s focus has shifted to how such structures populate the state space and trigger transitions, rather than expecting them to appear as steady patterns in experiments. Ongoing work continues to unravel the multi-stage transition to elastic and elasto-inertial turbulence $\u2013$ with arrowhead/narwhal waves serving as a valuable piece of the puzzle, albeit one with clear limitations. This critical understanding ensures that we appreciate the arrowhead structures for what they are: insightful and pedagogical solutions that illuminate EIT\u2019s mechanics, but ultimately unstable in the wild chaos of real 3D turbulence. --- > [!significance]- Metadata > Author:: [Vatsal Sanjay](https://vatsalsanjay.com) > Date published:: Feb 24, 2025 > [!meta] Back to main website > [Home](https://comphy-lab.org/), [Team](https://comphy-lab.org/team), [Research](https://comphy-lab.org/research), [Github](https://github.com/comphy-lab), [Blogs](https://blogs.comphy-lab.org)",

In the equal\u2010sized case, the wave curvature diminishes and then plateaus, whereas for highly asymmetric (large vs. tiny) bubbles, the curvature initially decreases but then rebounds sharply due to the changing geometry.

Beyond math, he helped calculate the orbit of the dwarf planet Ceres, co-invented an early telegraph, and teamed up with physicist **Wilhelm Weber** to measure and model the Earth\u2019s magnetic field.

Its integral form, $\\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = q_{\\text{in}}/\\varepsilon_0$, is most practically used with high\u2010symmetry geometries (spherical, cylindrical, planar). Even though it might seem universal, using it directly for complex geometries often requires additional methods. The differential form, $\\vec{\\nabla} \\cdot \\vec{E} = \\rho/\\varepsilon_0$, underpins charge\u2010field relationships in Maxwell\u2019s equations. Key insights include: _flux remains invariant if charges stay within the boundary_, and _external charges yield zero net flux through a given surface_. Applications to spherical shells, infinite planes, and wires highlight its computational utility. However, without symmetry, one typically reverts to direct integration or other approaches. Often, one of the first wonders students encounter in electrostatics is the deceptively simple yet powerful Gauss' law. I still recall my own initial surprise when I realized flux through any closed surface enclosing a single charge remained the same, no matter how oddly shaped that surface was. In this post, I hope to convey that same amazement while walking you through the essential details and derivations.",

A single point charge $q$ cannot remain in stable equilibrium under the electrostatic influence of other, fixed charges in vacuum. Can you think of a scenario? Say, we do. And now, let us enclose this $q$ within a small closed surface $A$. For $q$ to be in stable equilibrium, the net electric field from all other charges must point inward everywhere on $A$. Such an inward field is critical to create a restoring force for any small displacement of $q$. However, Gauss\u2019s theorem tells us that the total electric flux through $A$ must be zero if no net charge (creating this electrostatic field) is contained inside $A$. This zero flux requirement forces the field to have both inward and outward components on the surface, contradicting the need for a purely inward field. Hence, no purely electrostatic arrangement of external charges can hold a point charge in stable equilibrium in a vacuum. ![|250](20250121015925070_Gauss%20law%20of%20Electrostatics.png)",

Viscoelastic materials\u2014from polymer solutions to biological fluids, food products, and advanced materials\u2014exhibit both viscous (fluid-like) and elastic (solid-like) properties, leading to complex and often counterintuitive behaviors. Understanding these behaviors is crucial for applications ranging from inkjet printing and food processing to biological systems and advanced manufacturing. Building on our previous work with heat conduction ([[1st-workingAssignment]]), single-phase flows ([[2nd-workingAssignment]]), and simple multiphase flows ([[3rd-workingAssignment]]), we now tackle the additional complexity introduced by non-Newtonian rheology, viscoelasticity, and viscoplasticity.

For non-Newtonian fluids, this relationship becomes more complex: 1. **Viscoplastic fluids (e.g., Bingham plastics, Herschel-Bulkley fluids)** exhibit a yield stress $\\tau_y$ that must be exceeded before flow occurs: $$\\boldsymbol{\\tau} = \\begin{cases} \\tau_{y}\\frac{\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}}}{|\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}}|} + K|\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}}|^{n-1}\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}}, & \\text{if } |\\boldsymbol{\\tau}| > \\tau_y \\ \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}} = 0, & \\text{if } |\\boldsymbol{\\tau}| \\leq \\tau_y \\end{cases} $$ 2. **Viscoelastic fluids** exhibit memory effects, with stress depending on the deformation history.

The profound impact of elasticity on interfacial dynamics, from enhanced jet formation in bubble bursting to modified retraction behavior in filaments 3. The formation of unyielded regions in viscoplastic flows, creating complex solid-fluid transitions 4.
